*Project Idea*:

Sepsis is a syndrome in response to a systemic infection that can result in shock and multiorgan failure. Sepsis is the leading cause of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and the main cause of death in an ICU.  Moreover, sepsis is the most expensive health-care problem in the United States and the cost per case directly correlates with disease severity. The aggregate cost for the treatment of sepsis of all severities was approximately $55 billion.

*Do a correlation analysis to determine if*:

Increase in sepsis cost correlates with increases in survival, less hospitlization time, etc..
